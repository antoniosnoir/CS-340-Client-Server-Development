How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
    
The best and easiest way to write programs that are maintainbale, readable, and adaptable is to take a modular approach because this ensures that a program can be easily adapted to new needs, one that is also easy to maintain because of the logical order of the code while also being readable. Comments are also crucial to help others understand the code and modify it in any way they may see fit. 
    
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I always approach a problem the same way: by considering the requirements and then breaking them down into manageable components that I then work on bit by bit until achieving the final outcome. The biggest difference with this project was the extensive use of databases. In the future, I would like to work with someone or a team that has extensive experience in this in order to continue learning from them and have this process feel more natural. 
    
    
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

To put it plainly, computer scientists are at the crossroads of technology and creativity and they use skills to solve complex problems. This matters because computers and their programs are always evolving and our world is becoming increasingly dependent on technology. My work on this type of project would help a company by helping them obtain the information they need in a faster and more effective manner. In the long term, this saves the company a lot of money while simultaneously helping them grow.
